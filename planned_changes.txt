allow for -rm or something like that to exclude attempts from graph 

mayyyve add in notes per sesion 

potentially add in thresholds for sesions (i dont wanna penalize myself for adding in a casual session)

add in oct 10-21 sessions (no big deal) 

allow for output to file? 

make bash scrpit to run it easier 


should all take like 30 mins to add :)
